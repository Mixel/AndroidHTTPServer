_Multi-threaded HTTP server for Android devices_

Android HTTP Server is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server designed to run on Android devices, including smart phones 
and tablets.

*Currently Android HTTP Server is in an early state of development and should not be considered ready for "prime time"*.
However, as it currently stands it is able to stand-up to fairly vigorous multi-threaded benchmarking.  Early testing
using JMeter indicates that when running on a standard HTC Wildfire (533MHz) device running Android 2.2 it can serve
a test page at approximately 300 requests/s when debugging and approximately 1500 requests/s when not debugging.
