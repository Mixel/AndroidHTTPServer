_Multi-threaded HTTP server for Android devices_

Android HTTP Server is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server designed to run on Android devices, including smart phones 
and tablets.

*Currently Android HTTP Server is in an early state of development and should not be considered ready for "prime time"*.
However, as it currently stands it is able to stand-up to fairly vigorous multi-threaded benchmarking.  Early testing
using JMeter indicates that when running on a standard HTC Wildfire (Single-core MSM7225 528MHz) device running 
Android 2.2.1 it can serve a small test page at approximately 750 requests/min when debugging and approximately 2200 
requests/min when not debugging (based on 10 simultaneous JMeter threads - please check Test Plan.jmx for exact settings).
