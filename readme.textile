_Multi-threaded HTTP server for Android devices_

Android HTTP Server is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server designed to run on Android devices, including smart phones 
and tablets.

Currently there are two parts of the AndroidHTTPServer - the library project and the GUI project.  The library project is a
standard Android Library project which can be included in normal Android apps.  The GUI project is an example of a normal
Android app utilising the Android HTTP Server library, and demonstrates how to control the server via on-screen buttons etc.

*Currently Android HTTP Server is in an early state of development and should not be considered ready for "prime time"*.
However, as it currently stands it is able to stand-up to fairly vigorous multi-threaded benchmarking.  Early testing
using JMeter indicates that when running on a standard HTC Wildfire (single-core MSM7225 528MHz) device running 
Android 2.2.1 it can serve a small test page at approximately 700 requests/min when debugging and approximately 2000 
requests/min when not debugging (based on 10 simultaneous JMeter threads - please check Test Plan.jmx for exact settings).
