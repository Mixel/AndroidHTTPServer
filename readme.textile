h1. Android HTTP Server
_Multi-threaded HTTP server for Android devices_

Android HTTP Server is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server designed to run on Android devices, including smart phones 
and tablets.

It will serve static files from any accessible location on the device's available disks, including from the SD card. 

*Currently Android HTTP Server is in an early state of development and should not be considered ready for "prime time"
as it is missing a couple of fairly important security-related features, such as directory traversal etc*
