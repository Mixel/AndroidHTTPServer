_Multi-threaded HTTP server for Android devices_

Android HTTP Server is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server designed to run on Android devices, including smart phones 
and tablets.

*Currently Android HTTP Server is in an early state of development and should not be considered ready for "prime time"*
however it currently is able to reliably serve files from the device's disk (either on-board device memory or from
the SD card).
